# Shipping Sales Dashboard PROJECT
### 1.	Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze shipping sales data and provide actionable insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales growth trends. A dynamic dashboard was created in Microsoft Excel to track and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs), enabling quick decision-making by stakeholders.
The analysis focused on measuring overall sales, customer distribution, and performance efficiency, while also exploring relationships between customer demographics, shipping charges, and product category sales.

### 2.	Project Scope
**Objective:** To evaluate shipping sales performance and identify patterns that influence customer satisfaction and revenue.

**KPIs Defined:**
* Total Sales
* Average Sales per Unit
* Total Customer IDs

**Key Deliverables:**
* Interactive Excel Dashboard.
* Pivot tables for detailed analysis.
* Visualizations of sales, ratings, and customer behavior

### 3.	Methodology

**1. Data Collection & Import:** Raw data was obtained from internal shipping and sales records.

**2. Data Cleaning & Preparation:**
* Removed duplicates in customer IDs.
* Handled missing values in ratings and revenue.
* Create new calculated columns and Measures.
* Standardized product categories and location labels.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted using pivot tables, slicers, and charts.
  
**4. Dashboard Creation:** Designed with Excel charts, conditional formatting, and KPIs cards for quick visualization

**5. Insights Extraction:** Generated insights from pivot tables, correlations, and trend analysis.


### 4. Data Source

**Primary Source:** Company’s internal sales and shipping transaction dataset.

**Key Data Fields:** Customer ID, Product Category, Quantity, Order Value, Age Group, Gender, Rating, Location, Shipping Charges, Order Type (Local/International), and Order Date.


 ### 5. Tools Used

* Microsoft Excel (main tool)
* Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts.
* Slicers for filtering by category, date, and demographics.
* Conditional Formatting for highlighting trends.
* Formulas (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, IF, VLOOKUP, IFS).

### 6. Exploratory Data Analysis (Pivot Table Insights)

Several pivot tables were created to extract meaningful patterns:

* Average Rating Across Product Categories – Helped identify customer satisfaction per product type.
* Highest Average Sales Order by Age Group – Revealed which age segments contributed most to revenue.
* Gender Difference in Order Value & Quantity – Showed purchasing behavior variations.
* Shipping Charges vs. Average Rating – Indicated whether higher shipping fees reduced customer satisfaction.
* Location Quantity Sold & Average Revenue Performers – Identified top-performing regions.
* Sales Increase by Previous Month – Showed monthly growth trends.
* International vs. Local Order Ratings – Highlighted satisfaction differences between local and global customers.
* Average Sales per Unit by Category – Pointed out the most profitable product categories.
* Correlation Between Shipping Charges & Total Sales – Examined cost vs. demand relationship.
* Product Category Sales Growth Over Months – Showed seasonal/category-specific growth trends.


### 7. Results & Key Findings

**KPI Results:**
* Total Sales
* Average Sales per Unit
* Total Customer IDs

**Customer Behavior Insights:**
Younger age groups drove higher average sales orders compared to older groups.
Gender analysis showed females spent more in total order value, while males had higher frequency of smaller orders while males had a higher order quantity than female.
International customers gave slightly higher ratings, indicating possible satisfaction with shipping charges.

**Product & Category Insights:**

* Certain product categories had higher average sales per unit, making them revenue drivers.
* Categories with lower ratings correlated with higher shipping costs, suggesting pricing sensitivity.
* Top-performing regions consistently contributed to higher total sales and revenue.

**Sales Growth Trends:**

* Sales showed a steady month-over-month increase.
* Some categories experienced seasonal spikes, which could be leveraged for promotions.

### 8. Recommendations
  
* Optimize Shipping Costs: High shipping charges negatively affect ratings—consider adjusting or subsidizing costs for high-value orders.
* Customer Segmentation: Focus marketing efforts on high-spending age groups and regions to maximize revenue.
* Product Strategy: Invest in categories with high sales per unit and strong ratings, while improving underperforming categories.
* Improve International Experience: Enhance delivery times and customer service for international buyers to boost satisfaction.
* Leverage Trends: Use monthly sales patterns to forecast demand and plan inventory accordingly.

### 9. Conclusion
The shipping sales dashboard provided a comprehensive overview of sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. Using Excel’s pivot tables and visualizations, critical KPIs were tracked, revealing opportunities to optimize shipping, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive future revenue growth.
This project demonstrates how Excel can be leveraged as a full-scale analytics tool for KPI tracking, business intelligence, and actionable decision-making in shipping and sales operations.
